    "\n",
    "* **`find_reciprocity_pairs_and_similarity()` (The \"Helper\" Function):** This function has one very specific and difficult job: to find every valid `A -> B => B -> A` interaction and return the list of their similarity scores. This will be our **Test Group**.\n",
    "* **`response_similarity()` (The \"Main\" Function):** This function acts as the \"orchestrator.\" It defines the experiment, calls the helper function to get the Test Group, creates the **Control Group** itself, and then performs the final statistical comparison and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## The Helper Function: `find_reciprocity_pairs_and_similarity`\n",
    "\n",
    "This function builds our **Test Group**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Define Triggers (A) and Responses (B):**\n",
    "    * It loads the `matches_csv` to get a list of \"country subreddits.\"\n",
    "    * A **\"Trigger\" (A)** is defined as any *non-country* subreddit posting *to* a *country* subreddit.\n",
    "    * A **\"Response\" (B)** is defined as a *country* subreddit posting *to* a *non-country* subreddit.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Index Responses (An Optimization):**\n",
    "    * Instead of re-scanning the entire list of responses for every single trigger, it creates a `response_lookup` dictionary. This index allows it to instantly find all potential responses for a given pair (e.g., all posts from `'r/italy'` to `'r/formula1'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Iterate and Find Pairs:**\n",
    "    * It loops through *every single Trigger (A)* post.\n",
    "    * For each trigger (e.g., `r/formula1 -> r/italy`), it calculates the 7-day window *from that post's timestamp*.\n",
    "    * It uses the `response_lookup` to find all matching Responses (B) (e.g., `r/italy -> r/formula1`) that fall *within that 7-day window*.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Calculate Similarity:**\n",
    "    * If valid responses are found, it takes the **first** one (`.iloc[0]`).\n",
    "    * It gets the \"style vector\" (the list of 12 LIWC/VADER features) for the trigger post (A) and the response post (B).\n",
    "    * It calculates the **cosine similarity** between these two vectors.\n",
    "    * This similarity score is added to the `similarity_scores` list.\n",

    "2.  **Prepare Data:** Filters it down to only the columns needed for the style vectors.\n",
    "3.  **Get Test Group:** It calls `find_reciprocity_pairs_and_similarity()` to get the list of scores (`reciprocity_similarities`).\n",
    "4.  **Create Control Group:**\n",
    "    * It counts how many scores are in the Test Group (e.g., `N = 1,500`).\n",
    "    * It then creates a `baseline_similarities` list by **randomly sampling** `N` pairs of posts from the *entire dataset* and calculating their similarity. This list represents the similarity that occurs \"by pure chance.\"\n",
    "5.  **Run Statistical Tests:**\n",
    "    * It compares the two lists (`Reciprocal` vs. `Random`) using a T-test and a Mann-Whitney U-test.\n",
    "    * It specifically uses `alternative='greater'` to test our hypothesis: \"Is the Reciprocal group's similarity *greater than* the Random group's?\"\n",
    "6.  **Interpret Results & Plot:**\n",
    "    * It checks the **p-value**. A `p < 0.05` is considered a **significant result**, meaning the similarity we see in the Test Group is not just a random fluke. This provides evidence for our \"Stylistic Mirroring\" hypothesis.\n",
    "    * It then plots both distributions on a KDE plot, allowing us to *visually* confirm if the Reciprocal group's curve is shifted to the right (more similar) than the Random group's curve."
